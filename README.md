🌦️ Weather Dashboard in Power BI

📌 Project Overview
The Weather Dashboard is an interactive Power BI report that fetches data from a weather API to display real-time weather conditions and forecast trends for 10 major Indian cities. It provides a clear, user-friendly interface to track parameters like temperature, humidity, wind speed, air quality, and 7-day forecasts.
This project demonstrates data integration from APIs, ETL in Power BI, and dashboard visualization skills.

🚀 Features

✅ Real-time weather data integration using API
✅ Covers 10 major Indian cities
✅ Current and forecast weather insights
✅ Key metrics: Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, AQI, UV Index, Precipitation
✅ Interactive visualizations with filters and slicers
✅ Clean, modern dashboard design for better decision-making

🛠️ Tech Stack

Power BI – Data visualization and dashboard design
Weather API – Data source for real-time and forecasted weather
Power Query (M Language) – Data extraction and transformation
DAX – Measures and calculated columns

📊 Dashboard Insights

The dashboard provides:
City-wise Current Weather (Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, AQI)
7-Day Forecast Trends (Temperature & Rainfall prediction)
Comparative Analysis across multiple cities
KPIs for quick overview (Max/Min temperature, AQI alerts, UV index)

⚙️ How It Works

Connects to a Weather API (WeatherAPI or similar).
Extracts and transforms data using Power Query.
Creates calculated measures using DAX.
Builds interactive Power BI dashboard visuals.

📈 Future Enhancements

🌍 Expand to global city coverage
📱 Develop a mobile-friendly Power BI version
📡 Add live alerts/notifications for extreme weather
🔗 Integrate with external datasets (e.g., pollution, traffic)
